Scrumbot

First make a bot integration inside of your Slack channel. Go here:
https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot
Enter a name for your bot. Make it something fun and friendly, but avoid a single task specific name. Bots can do lots! Let's not pigeonhole them.
When you click "Add Bot Integration", you are taken to a page where you can add additional details about your bot, like an avatar, as well as customize its name & description.
Copy the API token that Slack gives you.

Then checkout this repo and add config file config.js with these options:
module.exports = {
  token: '<YOUR_BOT_SLACK_TOKEN>',
  statusChannelName: '<NAME_OF_CHANNEL_TO_POST_STATUS_RESULT>'
};

Then build it:
npm install

And run it:
node index.js

PM your bot user with command "status" and it will start getting responses from all teammates that are subscribed to the status channel.
