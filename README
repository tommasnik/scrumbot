Scrumbot
========

1. First make a bot integration inside of your Slack channel. Go here:
https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot
2. Enter a name for your bot. Make it something fun and friendly, but avoid a single task specific name. Bots can do lots! Let's not pigeonhole them.
3. When you click "Add Bot Integration", you are taken to a page where you can add additional details about your bot, like an avatar, as well as customize its name & description.
4. Copy the API token that Slack gives you.
5. Then checkout this repo and add config file config.js with these options:
```
module.exports = {
  token: '<YOUR_BOT_SLACK_TOKEN>',
  statusChannelName: '<NAME_OF_CHANNEL_TO_POST_STATUS_RESULT>'
};
```

6. Then build it:
```
npm install
```

7. And run it:
```
node index.js
```

PM your bot user with command `status` and it will start getting responses from all teammates that are subscribed to the status channel.
